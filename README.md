my mom has always warned me, going back to elementary school, that i should stay away from mediocre and jealous/envious people bc they can ruin lives. this is what shes always warned me about: small, insignificant, talentless, little, tiny people spreading rumors about me who cant even read the newspaper if their lives depended on it.
